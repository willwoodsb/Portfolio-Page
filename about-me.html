              <p>I am a highly motivated, logically minded and creative individual, 
              looking to pursue a career in Tech. To this end, I am currently
              studying on the Netmatters Code Bootcamp programme, which will give me the tools
              I need to be a highly proficient, full-stack developer.</p>
              <h2>Education</h2>
              <h3>BEng Aerospace Engineering with First Class Honours - University of Bristol</h3>
              <p>During my time studying as an undergraduate,
                I completed courses in C and extensively used MATLAB. My 3rd year research project was entirely 
                based on a MATLAB script I wrote, using aeroelastic models to predict the vibrational behaviour of 
                carbon fibre wing structures under aerodynamic loading. Furthermore, during a university-based research 
                internship, I programmed a radio-controlled breakable link for a water sampling drone using Arduino 
                code, digitally controlling analogue circuitry to create a current controller with a customised sampling 
                frequency.</p>
              <p>Studying engineering has afforded me an in-depth understanding of engineering principles both practically and theoretically stemming 
                from extensive teaching and applied group projects. Projects included successfully designing 
                and manufacturing a two-meter-long plane wing in a group of thirty-five, requiring strong 
                teamwork, communication and technical skills.</p>
              <h3>MA Popular Music Practice with Distinction - BIMM</h3>
              <p>This course was geared around a major project in which I wrote, produced and mixed an album of 
                original music, supplementing this with written documentation of the process that led to it. The 
                project involved collaborating with other musicians and sound engineers to record multiple 
                instrumental parts that I had written, requiring clear communication between all parties to produce 
                the best final outcome.</p>
              <p>Digital manipulation of sound is at the forefront of my practice, and as such 
                I am highly proficient at using audio software such as Ableton Live. I gain an enormous amount of 
                satisfaction from the creative process, whether I am writing and recording music or coding, I am most 
                engaged when I am working on a project that requires a degree of creative thinking.
